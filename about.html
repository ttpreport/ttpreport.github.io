<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hey, welcome!
</p>

<p>
Glad you're curious.
</p>

<p>
My aim is to cover tactics, techniques and procedures of real Bad Guys. No fluff, no marketing bullshit or dubious theoretical threats - just on point technical breakdowns and showcases. Kinda like Phrack and Uninformed, except I'm not as smart as those guys. Basically, PoC or GTFO.
</p>

<p>
In case you want to get in touch or be notified about new publications, my contacts, socials and rss feed are in the footer. Any tips about interesting threats or just some feedback is highly appreciated.
